# Text to Speech Application

A simple and interactive **Text-to-Speech application** that converts input text into audible speech.

This project provides a user-friendly browser interface where users can enter text and listen to it spoken aloud using the Web Speech API.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Convert text input into speech
- Adjustable speech parameters (optional UI sliders)
- Works entirely in the browser (no backend required)
- Clean and responsive UI with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

---

## 🧠 How It Works

This application leverages the **Web Speech API** built into modern browsers to transform text into spoken audio. When the user enters text and clicks the *Speak* button, the browser synthesizes the text into speech output instantly.
